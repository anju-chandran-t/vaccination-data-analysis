This project analyzes global vaccination coverage and disease incidence data to uncover trends, measure vaccine effectiveness, and support data-driven public health decisions.
An end-to-end analytics pipeline was built using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI.

The solution enables stakeholders such as public health agencies, governments, and global health organizations (e.g., WHO) to:

Identify regions with low vaccination coverage

Evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination programs

Monitor progress toward global health targets (e.g., 95% coverage)

Allocate healthcare resources efficiently
